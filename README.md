## Description
As an avid brewery visitor, I can find something to like about most places I go. Some places have great ambiance, others wonderful outdoor spaces, and a few have the best beer around. On rare occasion, a brewery might have all three. Swill is an app to help you find these rare gems. Making use of Open Brewery DB, you can search through a large collection of breweries around the United States by name, city, and state. You can add a review and rating for the brewery and see the reviews and ratings others have left, as well as the average rating for a brewery. All of your reviews will be added to your user profile, allowing you to keep track of breweries you've visited and what your thoughts were. You can also view the profiles of others and see their reviews, in case you want ideas of where to visit or avoid based on your friends tastes.
